#ETHERNET MAC ADDRESS
The Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) header is a fundamental part of the Ethernet frame, which is the basic unit of data transmission in Ethernet networks. The MAC header is placed at the beginning of the Ethernet frame and contains crucial information for the communication between devices on a local network. Here's a brief description of the Ethernet MAC header fields:

1. **Destination MAC Address (6 bytes):**
   - The hardware (MAC) address of the destination device. This field identifies where the frame is intended.

2. **Source MAC Address (6 bytes):**
   - The hardware (MAC) address of the sender or source device. This field identifies the sender of the frame.

3. **EtherType or Length Field (2 bytes):**
   - EtherType: Identifies the type of protocol carried in the payload of the Ethernet frame. Common EtherTypes include IPv4 (0x0800) and IPv6 (0x86DD).
   - Length: In IEEE 802.3 frames, this field specifies the length of the payload.

4. **Payload (46-1500 bytes):**
   - The actual data being transmitted. The payload size can vary between 46 and 1500 bytes. If the payload is less than 46 bytes, it is padded to meet the minimum frame size requirement.

5. **Frame Check Sequence (FCS) or CRC (4 bytes):**
   - A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value that allows the receiving device to detect errors in the frame. The FCS is used to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data.

The Ethernet MAC header is critical for Ethernet communication as it enables devices on the same network to identify each other, determine the type of data being transmitted, and perform error checking. The MAC addresses in the header uniquely identify each network interface card (NIC) on the network. Ethernet operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is widely used for local area networking.
