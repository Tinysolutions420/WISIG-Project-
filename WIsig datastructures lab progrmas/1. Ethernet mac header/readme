Certainly! Here's a formatted version that you can include in a README file:

## Ethernet MAC Header

The Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) header is a fundamental component of the Ethernet frame, which serves as the basic unit for data transmission in Ethernet networks. The MAC header, located at the beginning of the Ethernet frame, contains essential information for communication between devices on a local network. Below is a breakdown of the Ethernet MAC header fields:

### 1. Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)
   - The hardware (MAC) address of the destination device. Identifies where the frame is intended.

### 2. Source MAC Address (6 bytes)
   - The hardware (MAC) address of the sender or source device. Identifies the sender of the frame.

### 3. EtherType or Length Field (2 bytes)
   - EtherType: Identifies the type of protocol carried in the payload of the Ethernet frame. Common EtherTypes include IPv4 (0x0800) and IPv6 (0x86DD).
   - Length: In IEEE 802.3 frames, this field specifies the length of the payload.

### 4. Payload (46-1500 bytes)
   - The actual data being transmitted. Payload size can vary between 46 and 1500 bytes. If the payload is less than 46 bytes, it is padded to meet the minimum frame size requirement.

### 5. Frame Check Sequence (FCS) or CRC (4 bytes)
   - A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value that allows the receiving device to detect errors in the frame. The FCS is used to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data.

The Ethernet MAC header is crucial for Ethernet communication, enabling devices on the same network to identify each other, determine the type of data being transmitted, and perform error checking. The MAC addresses within the header uniquely identify each network interface card (NIC) on the network. Ethernet operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is widely used for local area networking.
